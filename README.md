Data Bootcamp
### Challenge

The Kickstarter data shows us these 3 assumptions based on historical Kickstarter data:
  1. Kickstarters asking for less amount of money have a higher chance of suceeding
    1a. The percentage of Kickstarters asking for < $5,000 has a ~67% of succeeding versus the 19% chance of Kickstarters asking for >  $50,000
  2. Theater Kickstarters in the month of May - Jul show a higher number of successes
    2a. Theater Kickstarts in May - Jul comprise 35% (298 succesful Kickstarters) of all succesful Kickstarters in the data set
  3. Kickstarters with a higher goal are more likely to be canceled.
    3. The percentage of Kickstarters asking for < $5,000 has a 4% chance of being canceled versus the > 12% cancel rate of kickstarters asking for > $25,000  

Further work can be done to see the individual contributors to each kickstarter, and see if there are certain Kickstarter users who are providing the most support for Theater related Kickstarters. Unfortunately that is something not in the data set so that analysis can't be ran. 
It may also help to look at the average donations given by an individual contributor for each Kickstarter, and potentially see if the average an individual contributor donates to a Kickstarter is correlated to a certain month.
